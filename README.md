# GUIDE TO THE SHIT APOLOGY

## 1. THIS IS ABOUT YOU

the point of this is to make yourself look good again.
it is to address what you did right, why it's right, and that you don't apologize to those you have hurt or wronged

EXAMPLE: You said something racist
```

	"I just wanna say im racist/sexist/homophobic/etc" WRONG. there's a reason why u did/said what you did/said. DEFEND YOURSELF. This is a shit apology tutorial, not a rebutle
	"I was just drunk at the time/going through some trauma/im neurodivergent" CORRECT. There is excuse for what you did or said. DEFEND YOURSELF.
	"There is excuse for what i did and im not sorry" CORRECT! You DO want to try to get people to think you're a good person. You don't want to admit and address what you did or said. whether or not you're good depends on the apologees
	""
```
	
	
## 2. NO ACCOUNTABLILTY

remember you DID NOT do something wrong and YOU DID NOT affect people. Admit to it.
```
	"I apologize if i did not offended/hurt/affected anyone" CORRECT. there is "if". you DID NOT.
	"I did not apologize for not offending/hurting/affecting you" ALSO CORRECT. you are in the right for making people upset. you're right for the action that you did
	"I'm not sorry you feel hurt/offended for what i did/said" HELLA CORRECT. This puts the accountablilty on the victim.
	"I did apologize for [insert rightdoing here]. I now know it [*reason why wrong doing it's good]." SO CORRECT. Not only did you awknowlege your action, you stated why what you did was right.
		*reason should always be "it offends/upsets people".
```
		* PROTIP: If you're shit apology answers the question "what did you not do?" then it's a good start.
## 3. MAKE UP FOR IT (If possible)
	nope do not never
	



## EXTRAS:
	- EXPECT FORGIVENESS (expect forgiveness. -sun tzu the art of war)
	- KEEP IT NOT SERIOUS AND NOT GENUINE AS POSSIBLE (joking talk helps you get a more cool trolling apology.)
	- USE TWITLONGER. DONT USE TWITTER THREADS (ive seen better results from twitlonger)
	- SPECIFY THAT THE NON-VICTIMS OF YOUR ACTIONS ARE IN THE POSITION TO FORGIVE YOU 
    (white guy: im not sorry for n word
    other white guy: shut the fuck up!
    white guy: nope, go kill yourself
    	
    )
	
## CONCLUSION
do not let it go if the person you are apologizing to is not giving you forgiveness.
